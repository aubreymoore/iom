# Digitization of literature about insects of Micronesia

The objective of this project is to harvest information from published literature on insects of Micronesia as part of an effort to build a biodiversity inventory for Guam. Taxonomic data, occurrence data and ecological associations will be extracted from these publications:

Source | Published by | Location
--- | --- | ---
Insects of Micronesia Series | Bishop Museum and University of Guam (Micronesica)  | Most issues available as online PDFs at <http://hbs.bishopmuseum.org/pubs-online/iom.html> and <http://micronesica.org/more/insects-micronesia>
Insects of Guam I | Bishop Museum | Hard copy available
Insects of Guam II | Bishop Museum | Hard copy available
Butterflies of Micronesica | University of Guam | <http://guaminsects.myspecies.info/files/ButterfliesOfMicronesia.pdf>

## Methods

* Data mining and validation will be facilitated by use of the [Plazi Golden Gate Imagine editor](http://plazi.org/resources/treatmentbank/goldengate-editor/). 
* Data extracted from each publication will be saved in a [Darwin Core Archive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_Core_Archive) for eventual ingestion into the Guam biodiversity inventory.

## Results

* As a test case, Donat Agosti used GG-Imagine to process the Insects of Micronesia issue on Eucoilinae (Cynipoidea) (available online at <http://hbs.bishopmuseum.org/pubs-online/pdf/iom19-3.pdf>) and posted results on [TreatmentBank](http://tb.plazi.org/GgServer/summary/30437113946AFF91825DFF8D9E42FFE8).
